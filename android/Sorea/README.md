## Project Overview
This project , a mobile application named Sorea aims to support youth mental wellness by creating a safe, anonymous, and interactive platform powered by Generative AI. Our solution combines AI-driven empathetic conversations, emotion tracking, and a community space to provide guidance, support, and a sense of belonging.
We believe that young individuals often hesitate to openly talk about their struggles. By enabling anonymous interactions with an AI wellness companion and a peer-supported, moderated community, we offer a safe channel for expression, learning, and growth.

## Key Features
1) Anonymous interactions with an LLM (LangChain + Gemini API) that remembers context, detects emotions, and gives empathetic replies.
2) Safe, anonymous, and moderated group discussions for sharing experiences without judgment.
3) Set wellness goals, unlock badges, and showcase achievements on profiles, with friends, or on social media.

## Why Our Solution is Unique
1) Unlike most apps that require sign-ups with personal details, our platform ensures complete anonymity while still offering personalized experiences.
2) The LLM doesn’t just answer questions — it detects and stores user emotions in a secure database, enabling empathetic and context-aware replies over time.
3) Combines the power of a personal AI wellness companion with a safe, moderated community space, striking a balance between private support and peer connection.
4) Encourages positive mental health habits through goal setting and badges, making self-care feel rewarding, shareable, and socially engaging.
5) Every community interaction is AI + human moderated, ensuring safety, positivity, and protection from harmful discussions.
